# Introduction
Thank you for providing me with this coding challenge. In this document, I will outline the core functionality I have implemented, along with areas for potential improvement and instructions on how to run the application.

# Core Functionality
I have completed the assignment by focusing on building the core functionality of the application. While the project is not entirely finished, it meets the requirements outlined in the assignment. However, there is room for improvement in certain areas.

# Areas for Improvement
Due to time constraints, there are some aspects of the project that I was unable to address:

- Docker Setup: I have not set up Docker for this project. This means that you will need to run the client and server separately.
- Testing: I have not utilized a testing library to test the components. Implementing unit tests would enhance the reliability and maintainability of the application.
# Running the Application
To run the application, follow these steps:

- Set Up MongoDB: Ensure that you have MongoDB configured on your local machine, as the application uses MongoDB as its database.
- Run the Client and Server Separately: Since Docker is not set up, you will need to run the client and server separately. Refer to the respective README files in each directory for instructions on how to run them.
# Video Demo
For a visual demonstration of the application, please watch the following video: [Coding Challenge Demo](https://www.loom.com/share/30656e58569842c5a3841f82d50477a2?sid=21b55153-b64f-4e98-8b1d-caa92ec0af51) 
# Conclusion
While there are areas for improvement, I believe that the core functionality of the application is solid. Thank you for the opportunity to work on this coding challenge.
